  Notes:

  - This VT is also reporting a flaw for other products affected by the same payload like Apache Struts

  - Some products might use Apache Struts internally and thus could be affected as well","The following vulnerabilities exist:

  CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do
  not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can
  control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers
  when message lookup substitution is enabled. This vulnerability is dubbed 'Log4Shell'.

  CVE-2021-45046: Denial of Service (DoS) and a possible remote code execution (RCE) in certain
  non-default configurations.","Sends various crafted HTTP GET requests and checks the
  responses.

  Notes:

  - For a successful detection of this flaw the target host needs to be able to reach the scanner
  host on a TCP port randomly generated during the runtime of the VT (currently in the range of
  10000-32000).

  - This VT is using a default list of static files known for Apache Struts and is also making use
  of a possible previous Apache Struts detection to extend this list. To broaden the coverage of
  checked static files it is possible to set the 'Enable generic web application scanning' setting
  within the VT 'Global variable settings' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288) to 'yes'.
